The camera is getting closer.
Paul takes his camera and films his big sister.
The children are playing in the yard.
Zoom in on a sheet.
Fade to black.
The scene ends.
The film starts.
Shooting in a natural setting.
The film is shot with a Super 8 camera.
The bloom is in the field.
A cow grazes in a field.
Flowers invade the fields.
The cameras are visible on the screen.
